13.08.2020 - Looked Go Lang Networking
	- Learned P2P implementation and implemented a program
14.08.2020 - Eliminated some sources, added some sources
	- Most of the papers was about queue policies not protocols
15.08.2020 - Read the `ACP` paper and `ACP Poster`
	- Looked up some tools used in the paper
	- ns-3 Network Simulator
	- CORE Network Emulator
	- GoLang defining a protocol 
16.08.2020 - Read `AAoI with HARQ` and `Optimizing AoI on TCP/IP with RL`
	- Both uses RL and action states
	- SVI, SARSA
	- Both does not define a solid protocol scheme
	- Did not read them fully
17.08.2020 - Unavaliable 
18.08.2020 - Unavailable

20.08.2020 - Unavailable
21.08.2020 - Meeting with Nail hoca
	- Changed the topic from protols to bufferless queues and limited buffer queues
	- Going to do simulations
22.08.2020 - Did nothing
